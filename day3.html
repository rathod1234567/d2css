    <div class="aside" >The journey to independence was long and arduous, spanning centuries of foreign domination. Mahatma Gandhi's philosophy of non-violent resistance and civil disobedience inspired a generation of leaders, including Jawaharlal Nehru, Subhas Chandra Bose, and others. The Indian National Congress, formed in 1885, played a pivotal role in mobilizing the masses and negotiating with the British.
        The Quit India Movement in 1942 marked a turning point, with widespread protests and demonstrations demanding immediate independence. The British, weakened by World War II, finally relented, and India became an independent nation on August 15, 1947.
        The partition of India and Pakistan, which occurred on August 14, 1947, resulted in one of the largest mass migrations in history, leaving deep scars. However, India emerged as a sovereign nation, with Jawaharlal Nehru hoisting the national flag at the Red Fort.
        Today, Independence Day is celebrated with fanfare, parades, and cultural events across India. The Prime Minister addresses the nation, highlighting achievements and future goals. The day serves as a reminder of India's rich history, its struggle for freedom, and the unwavering spirit of its people.
